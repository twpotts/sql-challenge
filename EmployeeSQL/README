Description:

This project turns 6 CSV files into 6 PostgreSQL tables and then runs 8 queries on them

Pre-requisites:

For the schemata.sql file to work properly, the user must have a folder called data stored on their C drive with the CSVs.
If not, then the schemata.sql file will need to be modified after each FROM statement to include a proper folder destination.

Folder contents:

EmployeeSQL

        departments.csv
        dept_emp.csv
        dept_manager.csv
        employees.csv
